Welcome to the Credit Card Customer Segmentation project repository! This project is a data-driven approach to developing targeted marketing strategies for financial institutions by analyzing the transaction behavior of credit card holders. Over a six-month period, the behaviors of 8,500 active credit card users were meticulously studied to identify distinct customer segments based on their spending habits, credit utilization, and repayment patterns.

Project Overview
This project aims to empower financial institutions by providing actionable insights through customer segmentation. By understanding customer behavior, the bank can create more personalized marketing strategies, improve customer loyalty, and optimize resource allocation.

Key Features

Data Preparation and Standardization: Cleaned and standardized a dataset with 17 features to ensure consistency and accuracy in the analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted a thorough analysis to uncover patterns, correlations, and outliers.
Dimensionality Reduction using PCA: Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dataset to 5 principal components, capturing the majority of the variance.
Clustering Analysis: Used K-means clustering to segment customers into distinct groups based on key performance indicators (KPIs). Identified four unique customer segments.
Strategic Recommendations: Provided insights and recommendations tailored to each customer segment to enhance marketing strategies.
Tableau Dashboard: Developed a Tableau dashboard to visualize customer behavior across the four clusters.
